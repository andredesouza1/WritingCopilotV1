The human brain is a complex network of neurons that communicate with each other to control various functions of the body. Within this network, a heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons plays a crucial role in controlling the flow of information through a neural circuit. These inhibitory neurons are responsible for reducing the activity of other neurons, thereby maintaining a balance in the brain's neural activity.

One of the ways inhibitory neurons control neural activity is through the formation of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neuron dendrites. These synapses modulate the summation of excitatory synaptic potentials, which are the electrical signals that neurons use to communicate with each other. By modulating these signals, inhibitory synapses prevent the generation of dendritic calcium spikes, which are sudden increases in calcium ion concentration that can lead to neuronal damage if unchecked.

In addition to modulating excitatory synaptic potentials, inhibitory neurons also play a role in controlling the timing of neuronal firing. Precisely timed somatic inhibition limits both the number of action potentials, which are the electrical signals that neurons use to communicate, and the time window during which firing can occur. This precise timing is crucial for the proper functioning of the brain's neural circuits.

The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 is known to regulate the number and function of inhibitory synapses in cell culture. However, until recently, it was unclear how this transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains of a neuron in vivo, or in a living organism.

Recent research has shed light on this question, showing that in the mouse hippocampus, behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinates the redistribution of inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron. This redistribution involves an increase in the number of inhibitory synapses on the cell body, coupled with a decrease in the number of inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites.

This rearrangement of inhibition is mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). Bdnf specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition. This means that Bdnf controls the inhibition that occurs at the cell body of a neuron, but not the inhibition that occurs at the dendrites.

These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how sensory stimuli affect neuronal activity. They indicate that sensory stimuli, by inducing NPAS4 and its target genes, differentially control spatial features of neuronal inhibition. This differential control restricts the output of the neuron, limiting its activity and preventing overstimulation. At the same time, it creates a dendritic environment that is permissive for plasticity, or the ability of the brain to change and adapt in response to new experiences.

In conclusion, the role of NPAS4 in the hippocampus is to regulate the distribution and function of inhibitory synapses, thereby controlling the flow of information through neural circuits. By doing so, NPAS4 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of neural activity in the brain, preventing overstimulation and promoting plasticity. This research not only enhances our understanding of the brain's complex neural networks, but also opens up new avenues for the development of treatments for neurological disorders.
